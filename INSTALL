This files depends on CUDA, NPPI and OpenCV.

I do advice you to install CUDA using this NVIDIA Developer webpage: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
In such case the installed CUDA also contains NPPI files. If you installed cuda using the apt repositories, some adjustments in the CMakeLists.txt file might be required.
You may also want to install libnppic, libnppif, and libnppisu.

For OpenCV I do advise you to install it through: "apt install -y libopencv-dev"
OpenCV is used for the display and file reading operations.
