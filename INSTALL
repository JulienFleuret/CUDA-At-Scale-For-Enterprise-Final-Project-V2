This project depends on CUDA, NPPI, and OpenCV.

To install CUDA, I recommend visiting the NVIDIA Developer webpage at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads. You can download and install CUDA from there. Note that if you install CUDA using the apt repositories, you may need to make some adjustments in the CMakeLists.txt file.

For NPPI, if you install CUDA using the recommended method, it will already include the necessary NPPI files.

Additionally, you may want to install libnppic, libnppif, and libnppisu.

To install OpenCV, you can use the following command: apt install -y libopencv-dev. OpenCV is used for display and file reading operations in this project.
